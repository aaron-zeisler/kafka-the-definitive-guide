# Chapter 3: Producers

I'm working through the book, hacking up each of the book's examples in Go.

So far I'm using [Confluent's Kafka client](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go).  I'd like to check out a couple more clients ... hopefully soon I'll have the time to re-write each example using [Shopify's Sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama), [Segment's kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go), and [Lovoo's Goka](https://github.com/lovoo/goka).
